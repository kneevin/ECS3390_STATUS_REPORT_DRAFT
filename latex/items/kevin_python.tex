\section{Python (Kevin Le)}

\subsection{History/Background}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Created in late 1980s and implemented in 1989, by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde \& Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. \cite{python_institute_about_nodate}
	\item Designed to be easy to read and write, with a syntax that emphasizes readability and simplicity
	\item Popularity has grown steadily over the years, and it is now one of the most widely used programming languages in the world
	\item Incredibly versatile language with a rich and collaborative community for all of its practical and niche uses
\end{itemize}
