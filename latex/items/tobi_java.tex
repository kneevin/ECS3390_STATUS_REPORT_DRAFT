\begin{itemize}
	\item Why Java?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Helps with learning coding fundamentals, when considering learning other languages such as Javascript or Python
		\item Highly sought after skill by businesses
	\end{itemize}

	\item Created in the early 90s by James Gosling (Sun Microsystems) as a convenient high level language for developing digital systems. \cite{javatpoint_history_nodate}, \cite{geeksforgeeks_complete_2023}
	 \item Initially named “Oak”
	\item Acquired by Oracle in 2009. \cite{ibm_cloud_education_jvm_2023}
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Practical Applications and Real-World Uses \cite{javinpaul_top_nodate}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Wide range of applications, including developing consumer electronics such as TVs
	\item Web/Mobile Development
	\item Cross-platform desktop applications
	\item Game development
	\item IoT on security/sensor devices
