\section{R (Abby East)}

\subsection{History/Background}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Created by statisticians for statistical analysis computation (to make doing statistics easier for people)
	\item R is a desirable skill for big tech firms, financial institutions, and biostatistics as well as in academic settings
	\item Anyone who uses data (software engineers, data scientists, quantitative analysts) benefit from familiarity with R
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Practical Applications and Real-World Uses}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Statistics
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Libraries created and largely contributed to by statisticians to aid their computational work in academia
		\item Programming tool for data scientists
		\item Library example: \texttt{stats}
	\end{itemize}

	\item Data Analysis
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Quickly reads in very large datasets (one of the main pros is that it deals with big data more efficiently than python)
		\item Easy-to-use libraries for intricate data visualization (highly customizable as well)
		\item Library examples: \texttt{ggplot2}, \texttt{dplyr}
	\end{itemize}

	\item Machine Learning
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Good for predictive models/supervised learning
		\item Most academics use R, so a lot of brand new techniques seen in research are published as an R package
		\item Also particularly good for regression modelling (estimating the relationship between variables)
		\item Library example: \texttt{caret}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Libraries and Communities}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{stats}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Already a part of R (package not library)
		\item Functions for basic statistical functions such as mean, median, and standard deviation
	\end{itemize}

	\item \texttt{ggplot2}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Used to make better data visualizations than the default r functions
		\item Very customizable and pretty to look at
	\end{itemize}

	\item \texttt{dplyr}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Used for data wrangling and analysis
		\item Helps organize datasets and make handling large amounts of data easier on the user
	\end{itemize}

	\item \texttt{caret}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Machine learning library used to split, train, and evaluate data
		\item Makes using a variety of different machine learning models accessible and simple
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
