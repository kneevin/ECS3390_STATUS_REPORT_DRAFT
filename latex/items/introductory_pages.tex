\section{A Gentle Introduction to Programming Languages \\ (Presenter to be decided later)}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The world of computer science is vast, and programming languages are an essential tool for anyone interested in pursuing a career in this field
	\item Programming languages are used to create software, develop websites, analyze data, and build artificial intelligence systems, among many other applications
	\item Each language will be presented with a brief history/background, an overview of its uses, and a discussion of its libraries and communities
	\item Our goal is to provide you with a gentle introduction to programming languages, giving you a basic understanding of the different types of languages and their uses
	\item In this presentation, we will introduce you to four popular programming languages: C++, Python, R, and Java.
	\item By exposing the audience to multiple programming languages, we hope to spark curiosity beyond this presentation
